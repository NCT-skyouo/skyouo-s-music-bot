# spotify-url-info

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/karlsander/spotify-url-info.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/karlsander/spotify-url-info)

This package can fetch useful metdata for spotify urls without needing a spotify API key. This is accomplished by some very light scraping. My usecase is providing a customized mini player preview.

__Warning:__ This library will not work directly in the browser, because the spotify page that it scrapes does not allow cross-origion requests. You can use it in node.js, in serverless functions and in react native. Alternatively use a CORS proxy.

## Usage

```bash
npm install spotfiy-url-info
```

```javascript
var { getData, getPreview } = require("spotify-url-info");
```

There are two functions: getData provides the full available data, in a shape that is very similar to [what the spotify API returns](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/object-model/) and getPreview always returns the same fields for different types of resources (album, artist, playlist, track). The preview track is the first in the Album, Playlist, etc. Both take a spotify URL (play. or open.) as input and return a Promise.

```javascript
await getData("https://open.spotify.com/track/5nTtCOCds6I0PHMNtqelas");
```

The fields `description` and `date` will be undefined for some types of media that don't have this information.

## Caveats

This uses cheerio to scrape the spotify twitter widget so it is unsanctioned and likely to break. I'll have the tests run on a schedule on travis ci so that I get notified when it will inevitably break. Then I can hopefully fix it. A more stable alternative is scraping the opengraph tags for the links with [open-graph-scraper](https://github.com/jshemas/openGraphScraper). The biggest issues there are no audio previews for artists and the number of requests it can take to get all the needed metadata.
