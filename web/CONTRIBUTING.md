## Note

### CSS
If you want to make some changes in the CSS style. Don't edit the `.css` file, use the SCSS file instead.

### HTML
Since we use Nunjucks, if you want to make changes to the HTML structure, make sure you change the source file (Nunjucks) located in `sources/pages`.

### Important!
It's better to use the code guide by [@mdo](http://codeguide.co). Before making a pull request, make sure you have compiled all source code such as SCSS, HTML and others. Most importantly, make sure your changes have been tested cross-browser and still use existing variables (if possible).
